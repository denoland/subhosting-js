# Deno Deploy Subhosting REST API client for JavaScript

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/subhosting.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/subhosting)

This library provides convenient access to the
[Deno Deploy Subhosting](https://deno.com/subhosting) REST API, which allows you
to programmatically deploy untrusted, third-party code into the cloud, from
server-side JavaScript/TypeScript.

The REST API documentation can be found
[on apidocs.deno.com](https://apidocs.deno.com/). The full API of this library
can be found in [api.md](api.md).

To learn more about Subhosting,
[check out our documentation](https://docs.deno.com/subhosting/manual).

## Installation for Node

Node requires dependencies to be preinstalled before executing your scripts.
Install the Subhosting client library from npm using one of the following
commands:

```sh
npm i --save subhosting
# or
pnpm add subhosting
# or
yarn add subhosting
```

## Usage

Before you begin, you'll need to have a Deno Deploy access token and an ID for
the Deno Deploy organization you're using for Subhosting.

- You can find or create a personal access token
  [in the dashboard here](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens)
- Your org ID can be found near the top of the page on your Deno Deploy
  dashboard [as described here](https://docs.deno.com/subhosting/api)

The code examples below assume your access token is stored in a
`DEPLOY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable and your Deno Deploy org ID is stored
in a `DEPLOY_ORG_ID` environment variable.

### Deno

The following example shows client initialization and usage in Deno:

```js
import Subhosting from "npm:subhosting";

const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  bearerToken: Deno.env.get("DEPLOY_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
});

const organization = await subhosting.organizations.get(
  Deno.env.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID"),
);

console.log(organization);
```

### Node

The following example shows client initialization and usage in Node:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```js
import Subhosting from "subhosting";

const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  bearerToken: process.env["DEPLOY_ACCESS_TOKEN"], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

async function main() {
  const organization = await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID");

  console.log(organization.id);
}

main();
```

### Request & Response types

This library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response
fields. You may import and use them like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```ts
import Subhosting from "subhosting";

const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  bearerToken: process.env["DEPLOY_ACCESS_TOKEN"], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

async function main() {
  const organization: Subhosting.Organization = await subhosting.organizations
    .get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID");
}

main();
```

Documentation for each method, request param, and response field are available
in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.

## Handling errors

When the library is unable to connect to the API, or if the API returns a
non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response), a subclass of `APIError`
will be thrown:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```ts
async function main() {
  const organization = await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID")
    .catch((err) => {
      if (err instanceof Subhosting.APIError) {
        console.log(err.status); // 400
        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError
        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}
      } else {
        throw err;
      }
    });
}

main();
```

Error codes are as followed:

| Status Code | Error Type                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |
| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |
| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |
| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |
| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |
| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |
| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |
| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |

### Retries

Certain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short
exponential backoff. Connection errors (for example, due to a network
connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit, and
>=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.

You can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```js
// Configure the default for all requests:
const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2
});

// Or, configure per-request:
await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID", {
  maxRetries: 5,
});
```

### Timeouts

Requests time out after 1 minute by default. You can configure this with a
`timeout` option:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```ts
// Configure the default for all requests:
const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 1 minute)
});

// Override per-request:
await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID", {
  timeout: 5 * 1000,
});
```

On timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.

Note that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).

## Advanced Usage

### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)

The "raw" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the
`.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.

You can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along
with the parsed data.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```ts
const subhosting = new Subhosting();

const response = await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID")
  .asResponse();
console.log(response.headers.get("X-My-Header"));
console.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object

const { data: organization, response: raw } = await subhosting.organizations
  .get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID")
  .withResponse();
console.log(raw.headers.get("X-My-Header"));
console.log(organization.id);
```

## Customizing the fetch client

By default, this library uses `node-fetch` in Node, and expects a global `fetch`
function in other environments.

If you would prefer to use a global, web-standards-compliant `fetch` function
even in a Node environment, (for example, if you are running Node with
`--experimental-fetch` or using NextJS which polyfills with `undici`), add the
following import before your first import `from "Subhosting"`:

```ts
// Tell TypeScript and the package to use the global web fetch instead of node-fetch.
// Note, despite the name, this does not add any polyfills, but expects them to be provided if needed.
import "subhosting/shims/web";
import Subhosting from "subhosting";
```

To do the inverse, add `import "subhosting/shims/node"` (which does import
polyfills). This can also be useful if you are getting the wrong TypeScript
types for `Response` -Â more details
[here](https://github.com/denoland/subhosting-js/tree/main/src/_shims#readme).

You may also provide a custom `fetch` function when instantiating the client,
which can be used to inspect or alter the `Request` or `Response` before/after
each request:

```ts
import { fetch } from "undici"; // as one example
import Subhosting from "subhosting";

const client = new Subhosting({
  fetch: async (url: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInfo): Promise<Response> => {
    console.log("About to make a request", url, init);
    const response = await fetch(url, init);
    console.log("Got response", response);
    return response;
  },
});
```

Note that if given a `DEBUG=true` environment variable, this library will log
all requests and responses automatically. This is intended for debugging
purposes only and may change in the future without notice.

## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)

By default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to
reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around
100ms off most requests.

If you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the
API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests
(be they http or https), for example:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

```ts
import http from "http";
import HttpsProxyAgent from "https-proxy-agent";

// Configure the default for all requests:
const subhosting = new Subhosting({
  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),
});

// Override per-request:
await subhosting.organizations.get("DEPLOY_ORG_ID", {
  baseURL: "http://localhost:8080/test-api",
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),
});
```

## Semantic Versioning

This package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as
minor versions:

1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.
2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or
   documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if
   you are relying on such internals)_.
3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in
   practice.

We take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely
on a smooth upgrade experience.

We are keen for your feedback; please open an
[issue](https://www.github.com/denoland/subhosting-js/issues) with questions,
bugs, or suggestions.
